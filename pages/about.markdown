Hello, I am Tecelli Akıntuğ, a Cypriot programmer/game developer currently living in France. I generally use C/C++ for my recreational programming and Godot for my games. I'm interested in all kinds of programming, mainly in graphics, and application development. I occasionally contribute to Godot Engine.

I will be posting here about my experimentations with different techologies, my exploration of different techniques and algorithms, my little recreational programming escapades, and my games.

You can reach me on my email [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}) or on my links below
