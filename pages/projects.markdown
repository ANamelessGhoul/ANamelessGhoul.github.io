Desktop app that can solve any [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) puzzle instantly using a backtracking algorithm made with Qt. It can als generate new puzzles that are guaranteed to be have only one solution. It also features undo/redo and import/export of boards.

The solver and Sudoku logic is written in C while the UI is written in C++ with Qt. Solver algorithm inspired by [Andrew Stuart](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Brute_Force_vs_Logical_Strategies).
