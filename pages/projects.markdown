Here are some of the projects I have worked on!

## Galaxy Clock
<iframe height="300" width="300" scrolling="no" src="/GalaxyClock/Game.html" title="GalaxyClock"></iframe>

Tiny desktop widget made with raylib and C++ using the immediate mode rlgl api. No assets are used, all graphics are dynamically rendered with opengl.

Source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ANamelessGhoul/GalaxyClock).

## Work In Progress
This page is still work in progress and does not include all the projects I want to show off.
