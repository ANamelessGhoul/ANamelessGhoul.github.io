You will find all the indie games that released or are close to release that I have worked on here.

## Re-Activated
Re-Activated is a 2D puzzle game about robots, where the main puzzle element revolves around controlling the rules of movement of a robot instead of controlling them directly. It was made in a custom version of Godot 3, which includes Steam integration, analytics, and a custom implementation of the FMOD sound library.
